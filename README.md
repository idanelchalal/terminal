# Terminal
Final Project at College 
The Project is composed by 3 parts: 
- [x] Client (Visualization of What's happening in the terminal: Flight's status, etc..)
- [x] Server (Charged of managing the flights steps, queue, landing and take-off.)
- [x] Simulator - An independent server which sends POST requests (Flights) to the Server (Terminal) every random time of seconds (Between 5 to 15).
